This is a folder for resources relating the final project. 

There is a marking rubric as well as course requirements. 

The final project must be a project utilizing JavaScript. It can be one of the following options (or, potentially something else if you want to email me):
<ol>
<li>Continue your midterm project with recommended direction from me.</li>
<li>Make your dream social media tool</li>

</ol>
